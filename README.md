# MediQueue

This was a project I worked on at a hackathon with a couple of other members in September 2020. This was my first hackathon, and I enjoyed it a lot. The web app we made is essentially a virtual queue for hospitals, where you enter all of your information and it automatically sends it to the doctors. It then gives you a number and puts you in line. This aims to reduce the amount of people at a hospital at a time, which decreases the spread of COVID-19 and also makes the process more convenient for both the patient and the doctor.
